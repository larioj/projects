# Problem
Guis are everywhere, and I have to agree that often
they are necessary. However there when it comes to
productive and power, nothing beat the CLI. However
at the current point there is an extreme division
between the two. It'd be nice if we could combine
them to get the best of both worlds.

Can we design a windowing system, such that you
can have the power of the command line, and the
gooeyness of guis?

## Features
Graphic Aliases: recipes.

## Possible Implementation
Piped Textual representation that gets interpreted
like webpages. We could interpose any other stage
in the creation of the textual representation, as
well as bind callbacks, and create a flexible and
composable gui experience.
