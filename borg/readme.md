# Business Organization: Distributed Enterprise Organization

## Problem
I'd like to work from home. I think commuting is a
giant waste of time and resources. The world would
be a better place if we didn't have to go to work.

## Solution
Let's build an environment that allows for collaboration,
and tracking. Employees can install this piece of software
on their work computers, and it will track their activity
and progress. It will allow people to be home, but at the
same time be under the supervision of the company. It may
sound a little like big brother, but when people choose
to work for a company their are trading their time for
and knowledge for compensation.

Can we make it so that everyone in an organization can work
from home?
