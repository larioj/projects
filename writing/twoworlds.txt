A tale of two worlds

There a two modes of computer interfaces, and
there are two modes of computing. The first and
older is classic computing which involves processes
and which later extends to windows. Everything is done
in the machine that the user is using. The second younger
version is web computing, in which the interfaces reside
in the local computer while, the underlying process can
be located anywhere. For individual users, this means
a sharp dichotomy of usage. A lot of time is spent
switching between the local machine and the cloud.
It is clearly better to have a hundred operations on
a single data struture, than ten operations on ten
data structures. For the sake of simplicity there is a
need to simplify the interface. This dichotomy is a drain
on the user. The real question is how do we bridge the gap
and create a unfied interface?
