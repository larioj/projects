# vim gui
So vim is notoriosly hard to learn, but the
world may be a better place if everyone knew it.
After conversing with a friend, I think maybe
a gui would do vim some good. Even though I don't
like guis that much.

## layout
The gui is a simple addition, just add a clickable keyboard
at the bottom of the vim screen. People can either click
on the virtual keyboard, or on their keys to invoke the
vim functionality. Also vim must start out in insert mode.
