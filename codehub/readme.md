## Motivation
Writing programs in a naturally social endeavour.
It would be fitting to treat it as such. The hacker
culture was born in the entrails of the internet
it should be hosted there.

Would it be possible to build a social network
out of collaboration on open source projects?
Repositories could be the center of congregation and
topics of discussion. People could achieve prestige
amongst their peers through contributions to code,
documentation and discussions.
